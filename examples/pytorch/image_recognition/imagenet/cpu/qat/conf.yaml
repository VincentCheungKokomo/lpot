model:                                               # mandatory. lpot uses this model name and framework name to decide where to save tuning history and deploy yaml.
  name: imagenet_qat
  framework: pytorch                                 # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.

quantization:                                        # optional. required for QAT and PTQ.
  approach: quant_aware_training                     # mandatory. supported values are quant_aware_training and post_training_static_quant.

evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in lpot.Quantization.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in lpot.Quantization.
    metric:
      topk: 1                                        # built-in metrics are topk, map, f1, allow user to register new metric.

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
