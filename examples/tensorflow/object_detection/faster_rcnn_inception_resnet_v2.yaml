model:                                               # mandatory. lpot uses this model name and framework name to decide where to save tuning history and deploy yaml.
  name: faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2
  framework: tensorflow                              # mandatory. supported values are tensorflow, pytorch, or mxnet; allow new framework backend extension.
  inputs: image_tensor
  outputs: num_detections,detection_boxes,detection_scores,detection_classes

quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 10, 50, 100, 200                  # optional. default value is the size of whole dataset. used to set how many portions of calibration dataset is used. exclusive with iterations field.
  model_wise:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
    activation:
      algorithm: minmax
    weight:
      granularity: per_tensor
      algorithm: minmax

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
