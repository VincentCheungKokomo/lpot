quantization:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 100                               # optional. default value is the size of whole dataset. used to set how many portions of calibration dataset is used. exclusive with iterations field.
  model_wise:                                        # optional. tuning constraints on model-wise for advance user to reduce tuning space.

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
    max_trials: 100                                  # optional. max tune times. default value is 100. combine with timeout field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
